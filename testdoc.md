### Step 1: Download the Eclipse Installer ðŸŒŸ

The first step is to download the Eclipse Installer, which will help you set up your development environment. You only need to download the installer once, and it can be reused for any future projects you contribute to. Choose the appropriate version based on your operating system from the links below:

### Step 2: Install a Project to Contribute to

Once you have the Eclipse Installer, you can set up both an IDE and a project to contribute to. Eclipse provides a special "setup" file for each project, which automates the installation and configuration process. You can find the full list of available projects in the `projets.md` file. 

However, to make things easier and get you started quickly, we recommend installing the setup for the **eclipse.platform.ui** project. This will allow you to get familiar with the contribution process.

___**Switching to Advanced Mode**___

To install both an IDE and a project simultaneously, you need to switch the Eclipse Installer to **Advanced Mode**. Here's how:
1. Start the Eclipse Installer.
2. In the bottom-left corner of the window, click on the menu icon ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc399fa9-0d54-4b67-8847-e9e8737d534f)

 and select "Advanced Mode" from the menu. 

___**Installing the Project**___

Once you are in Advanced Mode, follow these steps:
1. Copy the URL of the project's setup file (e.g., for **eclipse.platform.ui**, use the appropriate URL from the `projets.md` file).
2. Paste the URL into the filter field in the Eclipse Installer.
3. The installer will automatically find and select the correct setup for the project. You can then follow the steps to complete the installation.

___**Advanced Configurations**___

The Eclipse Installer also provides a range of advanced configuration options that are useful when working on more complex projects. These options allow you to customize your IDE setup, manage multiple environments, and more. For further details on using the advanced features of the installer, visit [this page](#).
